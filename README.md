# Visualize GRAPHIC 2 font descriptions

This script visualizes the [font descriptions](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/pdp7-unix/blob/master/misc/cas_syntax.txt) that come with PDP-7
(Unix) for the AT&T Bell Labs GRAPHIC 2 graphics display terminal.
It reads as input the [provided .cas files](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/pdp7-unix/tree/master/src/cmd) and generates as output
an SVG file with all characters as well as individual SVG files for
each character.

The generated files can be later converted into modern font files.
